Some code related to (very) basic electric circuit lab with Arduino board

## Introduction
It's April 2020, the world is fighting against the spread of covid-19. As a consequence all laboratory activities in schools/universities are stopped.

To lower distances with students,  in this repository I'm going to summarize some activities the can be performed at home with a low cost Arduino kit. All experiments are very basilar and related to a specific aspect of basic circuit theory. The main aim is to touch with hands concepts that would remain otherwise too abstract.

## YouTube videos

Each experience is accompanied by a YouTube video (Italian language only).

Currently, the following activities are present:
1. Open a Serial Communication with the Arduino board using the Serial Monitor integrated in the Arduino IDE and with Python (Python 3). `-->` [link to rev. 2](https://youtu.be/KZg1jX5p-ms)  ([old version](https://youtu.be/KZg1jX5p-ms))
2. Acquisition of an electric voltage. This is done using the application of a voltage divider. `-->` [link](https://youtu.be/61yXr3oFXwI)
3. Measurement of an equivalent resistance. `-->` [link](https://youtu.be/He_-ysi0Rd0)
4. ThÃ©venin's theorem: computation and experimental validation. `-->` [link](https://youtu.be/x--Q7AAMXXM)
5. Superposition principle: computation and experimental validation. `-->` [link](https://youtu.be/mZ2KitvKJQE)
